I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Language Technologies Institute advised by [Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/). I work on multimodal machine learning with the goal of enabling artificial social intelligence.

Prior to CMU, I worked with [Emily Mower Provost](https://emp.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, where I completed my B.S. in Computer Science. "In the wild", I can be found attempting overly complex french recipes, marveling at the crafstmanship of a particularly well made piece of outerwear, or appreciating [the perfect chocolate chip cookie](https://levainbakery.com).


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
