I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Language Technologies Institute advised by [Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/) and a visiting researcher at MIT with [Paul Liang](https://pliang279.github.io/) and the [Multisensory Intelligence group](https://mit-mi.github.io/). I work on recursively self improving AI systems.

Prior to grad school, I spent time as a chef, journalist, and math teacher. "In the wild", I can be found attempting needlessly complex recipes, marveling at the crafstmanship of a particularly well made piece of outerwear, or appreciating [the perfect chocolate chip cookie](https://www.burdickchocolate.com).


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
