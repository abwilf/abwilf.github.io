		<p> Hello!  I am a second year PhD Student at Carnegie Mellon's Language Technologies Institute advised by Louis-Philippe Morency in the MultiComp lab. I am interested in modeling social interaction using self-supervised and meta-learning methods.
		
		<br/><br/>
	My journey here was a winding one.  I have worked as a branch manager for a U.S. Senate campaign, an aide to my state's other Senator, 
	a Math teacher at a middle/high school in Costa Rica, a journalist at a daily newspaper in New Zealand,
	a cook at restaurants that have received the James Beard Award and Michelin one, two, and three star ratings,
	a software engineering intern at Uber, and as a research assistant with Professor Emily Mower Provost at the University of Michigan's <a href='https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~emilykmp/chai/research.html'>CHAI Lab</a>.
	I love hiking, singing, and cooking.
	"In the wild", I can be found attempting overly complex french recipes, marveling at the crafstmanship of a particularly well made piece of outerwear,
	or appreciating <a href='https://levainbakery.com'>the perfect chocolate chip cookie</a>. <br/><br/>

	If you have any questions, or just want to get in touch, please <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=alexdwilf@gmail.com&" target="_blank">reach out</a>!
